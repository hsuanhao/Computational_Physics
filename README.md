# Computational Physics and High Performance Computing

In this repository, I put reports for final projects I completed when I took **Computational Physics** and **High Performance Computing 1** courses.

1. [FinalExam_HsuanHaoFan.pdf](https://github.com/hsuanhao/Computational_Physics/blob/master/FinalExam_HsuanHaoFan.pdf) : The report on final exam, including 4 problems, in **Computational Physics** course.



2. [dft_project.pdf](https://github.com/hsuanhao/Computational_Physics/blob/master/dft_project.pdf): The report on final project in **High Performance Computing 1** course.

   - Rewrote parts of a real-space density functional theory (DFT) **FORTRAN** codes for metallic cluster by implimenting **OpenMP** and **MPI** to do **parallel computing on clusters** in computing center, [Center for Computational Research](https://www.buffalo.edu/ccr.html) (CCR).
